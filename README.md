**LifeSkills Coach** is an interactive web app that gamifies essential life skills with an RPG-style tracker.  
It helps learners build awareness and confidence in areas like **Road Rules, Hygiene, Waste Management, Digital Scams, and Food Safety**—all through a fun, challenge-based system. With badges, streaks, and an XP tracker, the project transforms everyday learning into a practical yet engaging experience.

## ⚙️ Constraints We Followed
We specifically followed three constraints while building this project:

1. **Track 6 – Single Request Samurai**  
   Everything works with a single HTTP request. After the initial load, no extra calls are made to the server—making the site lightweight and blazing fast.  

2. **Track 7 – Offline Survivalist**  
   Once the page loads, you can disconnect the internet, and the app still works flawlessly. All features are powered by local resources and `localStorage`.  

3. **Track 15 – Monolith Master**  
   The entire project is a single HTML file containing all logic, styling, and structure. This reduces complexity and ensures portability—you can run it anywhere with zero setup.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
